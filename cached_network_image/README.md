A Flutter library to show images from the internet and keep them in the cache directory.

**This is the actively maintained, high-performance community fork of [`cached_network_image`](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image).**

---

## 📖 The Story: Why this fork?

The original `cached_network_image` package by Baseflow is a titan in the Flutter ecosystem, used by millions. However, it has been **effectively unmaintained since August 2024**, leaving over 300 issues unresolved, including critical memory leaks and scroll performance bugs.

As the Flutter ecosystem evolved, the original architecture began to show its age. It relied on `sqflite` for cache management—a heavy, SQL-based solution that requires platform channels to communicate with native code. For a simple task like "checking if an image exists," this overhead caused UI jank in heavy lists.

**We created the Community Edition (`_ce`) to fix this.**

We didn't just fork it to merge dependabot PRs. We re-engineered the caching layer.

### ⚡ The Architectural Shift: SQLite vs. Hive

We replaced the heavy `sqflite` dependency with **[`hive_ce`](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_ce)**.

* **Old Way (`sqflite`):** serialized data → Platform Channel → Java/Obj-C → SQLite → Disk. (Slow, blocking).
* **New Way (`hive_ce`):** Dart Memory → Direct Disk Access. (Instant, non-blocking).

The result? **Zero-jank scrolling.**

### 🚀 Benchmarks

We benchmarked the cache metadata operations (checking, writing, and deleting cache entries) on an iPhone Simulator. The results speak for themselves:

| Operation | Payload Size | Original (`sqflite`) | **CE (`hive_ce`)** | **Improvement** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Read (Hit Check)** | 10 KB | 16 ms | **2 ms** | ⚡ **8.00x Faster** |
| **Write (New Image)** | 10 KB | 116 ms | **29 ms** | 🚀 **4.00x Faster** |
| **Delete (Cleanup)** | 10 KB | 55 ms | **19 ms** | 🧹 **2.89x Faster** |
| **Read (Large)** | 1 MB | 8 ms | **1 ms** | ⚡ **8.00x Faster** |

*Note: "Read" is the most critical operation for scrolling performance, as every list item checks the cache before rendering.*

## 🛠 Features

* **Drop-in Replacement:** 99% API compatible with the original package.
* **High Performance:** Powered by `hive_ce` for instant cache lookups.
* **Actively Maintained:** Regular updates, bug fixes, and community-driven roadmap.
* **True Web Support:** Unlike the original package, CE provides **full, persistent image caching** on the Web via IndexedDB (`hive_ce`), completely avoiding RAM freezes by using native image decoding sizes.
* **Interceptors:** Full HTTP and cache interceptor chains — add auth headers, inject synthetic responses, or selectively skip caching without forking the package.

## 📦 Installation

Run the following command:

```sh
flutter pub add cached_network_image_ce
```

## 💻 How to use

The API is identical to the original package. You can use `CachedNetworkImage` directly or via `ImageProvider`. Both approaches are fully supported with persistent IndexedDB caching on the web platform out-of-the-box.

### Basic Usage with Placeholder

```dart
import 'package:cached_image/cached_network_image.dart';

CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/350x150',
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
),
```

### With Progress Indicator

```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/350x150',
  progressIndicatorBuilder: (context, url, downloadProgress) =>
      CircularProgressIndicator(value: downloadProgress.progress),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
),
```

### Advanced Usage (ImageBuilder)

Use this when you need an `ImageProvider` for things like `DecorationImage`:

```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150',
  imageBuilder: (context, imageProvider) => Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      image: DecorationImage(
        image: imageProvider,
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
        colorFilter: ColorFilter.mode(Colors.red, BlendMode.colorBurn),
      ),
    ),
  ),
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
),
```

### Direct ImageProvider Usage

```dart
Image(image: CachedNetworkImageProvider(url))
```

### Network Timeouts (DefaultCacheManager)

You can configure network timeouts at the cache manager level using
`ConnectionParameters`.

```dart
final cacheManager = DefaultCacheManager(
  connectionParameters: ConnectionParameters(
    connectionTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 10),
    requestTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 30),
  ),
);

CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  cacheManager: cacheManager,
  errorBuilder: (context, url, error) => const Icon(Icons.error),
)
```

Timeout behavior:

* `connectionTimeout`: max time waiting for response headers.
* `requestTimeout`: inactivity timeout while streaming response bytes.

Both fields are optional and nullable. If `connectionParameters` is not
provided, existing behavior is preserved (no timeout is applied).

On Flutter Web, timeout settings apply when using
`ImageRenderMethodForWeb.HttpGet`. The `HtmlImage` render method uses the
browser image pipeline and bypasses the cache manager HTTP path.

### Cache and Metadata Directories

On native IO targets, cached image files and Hive metadata can use separate
base directories.

```dart
final cacheManager = DefaultCacheManager(
  cacheDirectoryProvider: getTemporaryDirectory,
  metadataDirectoryProvider: getApplicationSupportDirectory,
);
```

If `metadataDirectoryProvider` is omitted, metadata stays under the cache
directory:

```text
<cacheBase>/cached_network_image_ce/
<cacheBase>/cached_network_image_ce/hive/
```

**Web Platform Headers Support:** Custom headers (like `Authorization`) are
**only supported with `ImageRenderMethodForWeb.HttpGet`**. The default
`HtmlImage` render method does not support custom headers. If you need to
send headers to authenticate image requests on Web, you must explicitly set:

```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://api.example.com/image.jpg',
  httpHeaders: {'Authorization': 'Bearer token'},
  imageRenderMethodForWeb: ImageRenderMethodForWeb.HttpGet,
),
```

Note: Using `HttpGet` on Web disables the browser's default image caching
mechanisms, so images are cached via the `cache_manager` instead.

### HTTP Interceptors

Intercept and modify HTTP requests, responses, and errors before they reach the cache layer.
Useful for adding auth headers, logging, retrying, or short-circuiting with a synthetic response.

```dart
import 'package:cached_image/cached_network_image.dart';

class AuthInterceptor extends HttpInterceptor {
  final String token;
  const AuthInterceptor(this.token);

  @override
  void onRequest(HttpRequestData request, HttpRequestHandler handler) {
    request.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer $token';
    handler.next(request); // pass (possibly mutated) request to next interceptor
  }
}

final manager = DefaultCacheManager(
  httpInterceptors: [AuthInterceptor('my-token')],
);
```

Each hook must call exactly one of `handler.next`, `handler.resolve`, or `handler.reject`.
Failing to call any will stall the pipeline permanently.

| Hook | Trigger | Handler methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `onRequest` | Before HTTP call | `next(request)` · `resolve(response)` · `reject(error)` |
| `onResponse` | After HTTP response received | `next(response)` · `resolve(response)` · `reject(error)` |
| `onError` | HTTP call threw | `next(error, st)` · `resolve(response)` · `reject(error)` |

### Cache Interceptors

Intercept cache hit, miss, and store events to control how entries are read from and written to
the cache index. Only available on native IO targets (Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows) — not
available on web.

```dart
import 'package:cached_image/cached_network_image.dart';

// Reject storage for specific URLs (e.g. private/sensitive images).
class PrivateImageInterceptor extends CacheInterceptor {
  @override
  void onStore(CacheStoreData data, CacheStoreHandler handler) {
    if (data.url.contains('/private/')) {
      handler.reject(); // skip writing to Hive; file is delivered then deleted
    } else {
      handler.next(data);
    }
  }
}

final manager = DefaultCacheManager(
  cacheInterceptors: [PrivateImageInterceptor()],
);
```

| Hook | Trigger | Handler methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `onHit` | Cached entry found and valid | `next(data)` · `resolve(fileInfo)` · `reject` (force re-download) |
| `onMiss` | No cached entry found | `next(data)` · `resolve(fileInfo)` (skip download entirely) |
| `onStore` | After download, before writing metadata | `next(data)` · `reject` (skip persisting; cache file deleted) |

When `onStore` rejects, the downloaded file is copied to a system-temp location, the
cache-directory copy is deleted (no orphan), and the temp copy is yielded to the caller for
this request only.

### Unsupported Image Formats (SVG, JXL, AVIF, HEIC, ...)

Flutter's built-in image codec can't decode every format — SVG never works
(it's not a raster format), and some raster formats (JXL, AVIF, HEIC, ...) may
fail depending on platform/OS codec support. When `CachedNetworkImage` detects
SVG bytes, or the codec otherwise fails to decode the cached bytes, it throws
an `UnsupportedImageFormatException` instead of leaving you with an opaque
decode error. Use the `unsupportedImageBuilder` callback to render the raw
bytes with a format-specific package of your choice — e.g.
[`flutter_svg`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) for SVG, or
[`flutter_avif`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_avif) for AVIF:

Before using `SvgPicture.memory`, add `flutter_svg` to `pubspec.yaml`
(`dependencies: flutter_svg: ^2.2.1`) and import
`package:flutter_svg/flutter_svg.dart`.

```dart
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.svg',
  unsupportedImageBuilder: (context, url, bytes) {
    // `bytes` are the already-cached file bytes.
    return SvgPicture.memory(bytes); // from flutter_svg
  },
  placeholder: (context, url) => CircularProgressIndicator(),
  errorWidget: (context, url, error) => Icon(Icons.error),
),
```

The image is still downloaded and cached normally — only the **rendering**
path is different. If `unsupportedImageBuilder` is not set, the error falls
through to `errorWidget` with an `UnsupportedImageFormatException`.

SVG is detected ahead of time, so its exception carries
`detectedFormat: 'svg'`. Any other codec decode failure (JXL, AVIF, HEIC, or a
genuinely corrupt file) is only caught once decoding is actually attempted, so
`detectedFormat` is `null` in that case — check the bytes yourself (e.g. magic
numbers) if you need to distinguish which format/decoder to use inside
`unsupportedImageBuilder`.

**Web caveat:** this whole mechanism requires the raw cached bytes, so it only
works with `ImageRenderMethodForWeb.HttpGet`. The default `HtmlImage` render
method hands the URL straight to the browser's native image pipeline and never
has bytes to inspect, so a decode failure there falls straight through to
`errorBuilder`/`errorWidget` as a plain error, not an
`UnsupportedImageFormatException`.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will I lose my users' existing cache if I migrate?**
A: Yes. Because we switched the storage engine from SQLite to Hive, the old cache files will be ignored. Users will re-download images once as they browse. This is a one-time migration cost for a permanent performance gain.

**Q: My app crashes/pauses on errors?**
A: In Debug mode, Flutter may pause on exceptions even if they are caught. This is expected behavior for network errors (404s). In Release mode, these are handled silently by the `errorWidget`.

**Q: Why is web caching slower or using Hive for image bytes?**
A: On Mobile & Desktop (IO), this package stores image bytes directly on the incredibly fast native file system, and uses Hive *only* for metadata. The Web platform, however, lacks a native file system. Therefore, for web we use `hive_ce` to store both metadata and the actual image bytes in IndexedDB. Serializing large byte arrays in and out of IndexedDB introduces overhead that isn't present on IO. 
*Alternative:* If persistent caching across sessions isn't critical for your web users, consider conditionally using the standard `Image.network` on the web, which relies on the browser's built-in memory/HTTP caching to achieve faster decoding.
